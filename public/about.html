<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sanskriti Sharma. I'm a 3rd year college student in CMRIT college. 
  I'm currently pursuing my bachelors degree in Engineering of Computer Science with Data Science.
I started doing this course to gain knowledge and increase my skills.</p>

<p>My dad is in India Air Force so I have changed many schools and met many people. I have been to mostly all over India.
  This gave me an oppurtunity to learn about so many different cultures and traditions.
  Till now I have changed 6 schools and lived in 8 cities.
</p>

<p>My plan is to pursue Masters degree after my bachelors degree from abroad.
  I have plans to do Masters in Data Science or AI and ML, I still have to decide from these two.
  I love to learn new things. Specially languages. Learning new things is one of my hobby you can say.
